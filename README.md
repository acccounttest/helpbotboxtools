This is a way to compute the coordinates in the rendered screen mini map to allow paste a command that can execute in a server side, a global boxes player start positions in a minimap by drawing to the lobby client.

So it is manual and there is no algorithm to proceed to a perfect symetric final decision englobing any or all player possible coordinates, this is only intended to produce equivalent boxes start positions values accordingly to the user drawings, firstly, due to the simplicity of the compatibility(OS and softwares all cofounded), the user has to press the mouse keys in their main window, surround the map coordinates and then only draw other areas inside the main, and in the end paste the coordinates by using keyboard main keys, i suggest you to change the final trigger keys to paste the command with your appropriated keyboard layout or changethem by the numpad shortcuts in AHK.

Don't forget to close it while in game , it occup the shift keys and it could be not available while script is running, once again to permit the compatibility to not be just a simpler list of softwares and usages of this.
